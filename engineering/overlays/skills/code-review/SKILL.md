description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) on two separate axes, the repo's coding standards and the originating spec, reported side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."

# Code Review

Review the diff from a fixed point to the current work on two axes, each in its own fresh-context sub-agent so neither colours the other, run in parallel:

- **Standards**: does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does it do what the originating issue or spec asked?

A change can pass one and fail the other (the right thing built against convention, or the wrong thing built well), so the axes stay separate from review to report.

The tracker comes from `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. If it is missing, tell the user to run `/setup-engineering-workflow-for-apm`.

## 1. Pin the diff

The fixed point is whatever the user named (SHA, branch, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`); ask if they named none. Check that it resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and that the diff is non-empty before starting either reviewer.

- Diff: `git diff $(git merge-base <fixed-point> HEAD)`, against the merge-base and including uncommitted work. Untracked files are not in it; add those listed by `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`.
- Commits: `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

## 2. Find the spec

In order: issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`), fetched per `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`; a path the user passed; a spec file under `docs/`, `specs/` or `.scratch/` matching the branch or feature; otherwise ask the user. If there is none, skip the Spec axis and say so in the report.

## 3. Find the standards

Whatever the repo documents about how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`. On top of that, the Standards axis always applies this baseline of Fowler smells (*Refactoring*, ch. 3):

> Mysterious Name, Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Repeated Switches, Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality (anything the spec doesn't need), Message Chains, Middle Man, Refused Bequest.

A documented repo standard overrides the baseline. A smell is always a labelled judgement call with its fix ("possible Feature Envy: move the method onto the data it uses"), never a hard violation. Skip anything tooling already enforces.

## 4. Run both reviewers in parallel

Each gets the diff command, any untracked files, and the commit list, plus:

- **Standards**: the standards files and the smell baseline above, pasted in full since it has no other access to it. Brief: report per file or hunk (a) each breach of a documented standard, citing the file and rule, and (b) each baseline smell, named, with the hunk quoted. Mark documented-standard breaches as hard violations or judgement calls; smells are always judgement calls. Skip what tooling enforces. Under 400 words.
- **Spec**: the spec's path or fetched contents. Brief: report (a) requirements missing or partial, (b) behaviour nobody asked for, (c) requirements that look implemented but wrong, quoting the spec line for each. Under 400 words.

## 5. Report

Show the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec`, verbatim or lightly cleaned, without merging or reranking findings. End with one line: the finding count per axis and the worst finding within each axis, never one winner across both.
