Write a handoff document that lets a fresh agent continue the work, and save it in the OS temporary directory, not the workspace.

- Treat any arguments as what the next session will focus on, and tailor the document to it.
- Include a "Suggested skills" section naming the skills the next agent should load.
- Point to specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits and diffs by path or URL instead of copying them.
- Redact secrets and personal data.
