Implement the work the user points to in the spec or tickets.

- Build test-first with the `tdd` skill wherever it fits, at the seams the spec agreed.
- Typecheck and run the affected test files as you go; run the full suite once, at the end.
- Review the result with the `code-review` skill against the commit you started from, and address its findings.
- Commit to the current branch.
