# Tracker: GitHub

How the loop's issue conventions ([issues.md](issues.md)) are done on GitHub. A project
whose `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` says `Tracker: GitHub (engineering-loop's github.md)`
follows this file in place, never a copy, so a fix here reaches every project. Run `gh`
inside the repository: it infers the repo from the remote.

## Operations

- Create: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- Read: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- List: `gh issue list --state all --json number,title,body,labels,url`
- Comment: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- Label: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- Close: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`
- Parent: an issue has at most one, and `addSubIssue` refuses a pair that already exists,
  so read the sub-issue's parent and both node ids first:
  `gh api graphql -F owner='{owner}' -F name='{repo}' -F n=<sub-issue> -F p=<parent> -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$n:Int!,$p:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){issue(number:$n){id parent{number}} parent:issue(number:$p){id}}}'`.
  No parent yet:
  `gh api graphql -f p=<parent id> -f s=<sub-issue id> -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$s:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$s}){subIssue{parent{number}}}}'`.
  Already that parent: done. Another parent: it belongs to that epic; `replaceParent:true`
  moves it only when that one is wrong.
- Write access, which `spec: auto unless risk` asks of a sub-issue's author: GitHub's
  collaborator permission, `gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/<login>/permission' --jq .permission`,
  is `admin`, `maintain` or `write`. It covers access through a team, which an issue's
  `author_association` does not.
- Risk, on an issue or a PR: `gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<number>/labels' -f 'labels[]=risk:high'`,
  the call `approvals.py` makes, which creates the label where the repo has none.
- Epic: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label epic`, after
  `gh label create epic --color 8250DF --description "An outcome the owner tracks; its work items are sub-issues"`
  when the repo has no such label.

Pull requests are not a triage request surface.

## Labels

`python3 scripts/labels.py` syncs the repo's labels with issues.md, Labels; `--dry-run`
prints the same plan and writes nothing. Run it by hand, `--dry-run` first: the project's
`mise run setup:github` runs it only once project-templates wires it in. Its docstring says what it does, in order. The calls it makes:

- Rename in place, so every open and closed issue and PR keeps the label and its timeline
  shows no remove and add: `gh api -X PATCH 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels/<old>' -f new_name=<new>`
  (`gh label edit <old> --name <new>` is the same call). GitHub refuses a new name that
  exists, so a fold adds the new label to each carrier and removes the old, then deletes it.
- Who carries a label, open and closed, issues and PRs:
  `gh api --paginate -X GET 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues' -f labels=<name> -f state=all -f per_page=100 --jq '.[].number'`.
  A label any issue or PR carries is never deleted, since that loses who had it.

## Assignee

The calls behind issues.md, Assignee. `python3 scripts/approvals.py check build <pr>` reads
who added `approved:spec` (the approver) from the issue's timeline, refuses an issue
assigned to anyone else, and, once every build proof holds, assigns the approver where no
one is and the PR its issue's assignees. Before assigning it comments `Assigned: @<login>`
on the issue as the record that the loop made the assignment; when that comment is refused
it says so and leaves the issue unassigned. When you park an issue (`needs-owner`) or drop
it, run `python3 scripts/approvals.py release <issue>`: it removes an assignee that record
names, unless someone assigned them again after the loop did, and keeps any other. Assign by hand
only a person: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee <login>`.

## Review trail

The calls behind SKILL.md, Review trail on the PR. `gh api` fills `{owner}` and `{repo}`
from the remote.

- Post a pass: `python3 scripts/approvals.py verdict <pr> <report>`. It posts one review
  on the report's `Head:` commit, event `COMMENT`, because GitHub refuses
  `REQUEST_CHANGES` and `APPROVE` on your own PR. One comment whose path or line is outside
  the PR's diff at that commit refuses the whole review (422, `Path could not be resolved`
  or `Line could not be resolved`), so `verdict` moves a line to the nearest diff line and
  puts a finding whose file is outside the diff in the body.
- List the threads, each with the id to resolve it and its first comment's id to reply:
  `gh api graphql -F o='{owner}' -F r='{repo}' -F n=<pr> -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$n:Int!){repository(owner:$o,name:$r){pullRequest(number:$n){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id isResolved path line comments(first:1){nodes{databaseId body}}}}}}}'`.
- Reply on a thread: `gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments/<first comment databaseId>/replies' -f body="Fixed in <sha>."`
- Resolve it with the triage's reason, `ADDRESSED`, `WONT_FIX` or `INVALID` (SKILL.md,
  Review trail on the PR): `gh api graphql -f t=<thread id> -f r=ADDRESSED -f query='mutation($t:ID!,$r:PullRequestReviewThreadResolutionReason){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$t,resolutionReason:$r}){thread{isResolved}}}'`.
  GitHub keeps no readable reason, so the reply says why.
- Dismiss a review, only as SKILL.md, Review trail on the PR allows:
  `gh api -X PUT 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/reviews/<id>/dismissals' -f message="<the owner's ask, quoted>" -f event=DISMISS`.
- `gh pr create --draft` needs a commit the base lacks: before anything is built, push an
  empty one (`git commit --allow-empty -m "<spec title>"`), which the squash drops.

## Board

A GitHub Projects board linked to the repo (the `github-project-board-setup` skill of the
`utilities` plugin creates one, with an Epics view and the Parent issue and Sub-issues
progress fields shown). `python3 scripts/board.py <issue> <column>` adds the
issue when it is missing and sets its column; it is the only thing that moves a ticket, so
the board's own "Item closed" and "Auto-add" workflows stay off, as they are on a board
created through the API. Its views show the Assignees field next to Status, so the board
shows whose each ticket is. `python3 scripts/board.py column <issue>` prints the later of the
issue's board column and the one its labels give, so an issue with `approved:spec` reads
`Ready` even when its move failed or the repo has no board.

## Publish an issue batch

Every set of issues an engineering skill produces is one publication batch. It is
fingerprinted and resumable so that an interrupted run neither duplicates nor loses an
issue.

### Canonical batch

- Titles are the issues' identities inside the batch. Stop on a duplicate title, an
  unknown blocker or a dependency cycle.
- Order: repeatedly take, among the tickets whose blockers are all already ordered, the
  one with the smallest exact UTF-8 title bytes; number them from 1 as `order`.
- Sort and deduplicate each issue's labels by exact UTF-8 bytes and its blockers by
  their `order`. Preserve titles and bodies byte-for-byte.
- Serialize the array of issues, in `order`, as UTF-8 JSON with only `title`, `body`,
  `labels`, `blockers` and `order`: object keys sorted, Unicode characters emitted
  directly, comma and colon separators without surrounding whitespace. The lowercase
  hexadecimal SHA-256 of those bytes is `batch_sha256`.
- Append each issue's marker to its body after a blank line:
  `<!-- agent-skills-batch:{batch_sha256}:ticket:{ordinal} -->`

### Durable state

Store the approved batch at
`.scratch/agent-skills/github-issue-batches/{batch_sha256}.json` with `version`,
`batch_sha256`, `approved`, the complete canonical issue array (each issue also holding
its marker, marked body, and resolved URL or `null`), and a `relationships` array
recording each edge's blocked order, blocker order, and `pending` or `confirmed` status.

Write state atomically after every transition: sibling temporary file, flush and
`fsync`, atomic replace, `fsync` of the parent directory. A partially written file is
never valid resume state. Stop when an existing state file is malformed, or its
fingerprint or canonical batch differs from the current batch.

### First publication

1. Search every marker across all issue states with
   `gh issue list --state all --search "<marker>" --json url,body`, and count only
   bodies that contain the exact marker. Record a single match's URL in the proposed
   state. When several issues contain one marker, stop before approval and report every
   matching URL.
2. Render one numbered review with every issue's order, title, complete marked body,
   labels and blockers, then the exact remaining write plan: each missing issue
   creation followed by each pending relationship edit.
3. When the plan contains external writes, ask exactly:
   “Create these GitHub Issues now?”
   Rejection, an edit request or no answer records no approval and writes nothing. A changed title, body, label, blocker or derived order is a new fingerprint
   and starts this flow over.
4. After approval, atomically persist the exact batch with `approved: true`, then run
   the first mutating `gh` command with no remote read in between.

### Create and resume

A run on an exact, already approved batch keeps its recorded approval. Before the next
external write, search every marker again, reconcile each unique match into state and
persist it; this recovers an issue GitHub created when the command response or the
following state write was lost.

- Create only issues whose URL is still `null`, in canonical order, passing the
  approved title, marked body and labels unchanged to `gh issue create`. Persist and
  print each returned URL immediately.
- On any command failure or interruption, stop with the current durable state; the next
  run reconciles again and does not ask for approval of the same fingerprint.
- Once every issue has a URL, add the native sub-issue and blocking relationships in
  canonical edge order with an idempotent add, so replaying a pending edge yields the
  same graph. Mark an edge `confirmed` only after its command succeeds. Where native
  relationships are unavailable, make an idempotent body update with the confirmed
  `Part of` and `Blocked by` URLs.

Approval covers only the displayed missing issue creations and relationship edits for
this fingerprint. Closing, commenting on, relabeling, assigning or editing unrelated
issues needs separate authority.
