"""Label sync (engineering loop): make the repo's labels the loop's fixed set plus docs/agents/issue-tracker.md's.

    python3 scripts/labels.py [--dry-run]

Run in the checkout; the project's `mise run setup:github` runs it. One line per change, then one per label it keeps:

- Renames first, in place (`PATCH labels/<old>`), so every open and closed issue and PR keeps its label: the
  tracker's `## Renamed labels` map, then the loop's own (`bug`, `enhancement` and `chore` to their `kind:` names,
  `documentation` folded into `kind:chore`), then each component's and extra category's bare name to its `area:` or
  `kind:` label. A rename whose new name already exists is a fold: each issue or PR with the old label gets the new
  one and loses the old, then the old is deleted. An old name the repo lacks is skipped, so the map can stay.
- Then it creates every listed label it lacks and updates one whose colour or description differs. A tracker item's
  description is its text after the name, cut to GitHub's 100 characters.
- Then each unlisted label: deleted when no issue or PR, open or closed, carries it, else kept and reported with its
  count, since deleting it would lose who had it. Dependabot's are kept, since it recreates them and its PRs use them.

A second run changes nothing. `--dry-run` reads the same and writes nothing. Without docs/agents/issue-tracker.md it
refuses, since nothing would say which labels are the repo's. Exit 1 with gh's reason. Stdlib only.
