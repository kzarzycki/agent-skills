"""Ruleset drift (engineering loop): commit what the repo's rulesets are meant to block, and notice when they stop.

    uv run scripts/rulesets.py snapshot [--repo OWNER/REPO]
    uv run scripts/rulesets.py check [--repo OWNER/REPO ...]

A ruleset with no bypass actors blocks force-pushes, deletions and direct pushes for everyone, admins included. Only
an edit of the ruleset itself gets past it, and GitHub sends no alert for one, so a project runs `check` on a schedule
(for example from its hygiene job).

- `snapshot` writes each live ruleset to `.github/rulesets/<name>.json` (spaces in the name become `-`) in the
  checkout, keeping only the fields that decide what it blocks: `name`, `target`, `enforcement`, `conditions`, `rules`
  and `bypass_actors`. A repo commits the result through a normal PR.
- `check` reads the expected files from each repo's default branch through the API, not the working tree, so it works
  from any checkout and a local edit can't hide drift, and compares them with the live rulesets. One line per
  difference, exit 1: a ruleset missing; enforcement not as expected; `conditions`, `target` changed; a rule removed,
  added or with other parameters; a bypass actor added or removed. Any difference counts, a stricter one included: an
  intended change lands as a PR that updates the file. Nothing differs: no output, exit 0. A repo with no
  `.github/rulesets/` is skipped with a note, not failed.

Without `--repo` both act on gh's default repo. Exit 1 with gh's reason on an API error. Stdlib, and PyYAML through approvals.py.
