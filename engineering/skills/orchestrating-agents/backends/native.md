# Orchestrating with native subagents

The default backend: every harness has one, and it needs no setup.

- **Start:** your harness's own subagent tool, in the background, working in the item's
  worktree. The first message is the role file's path plus the specifics (spec and item,
  worktree, branch, base, report path). Name agents by spec, item and role
  (`s120-parser-worker`, `s120-verifier-p1`: one verifier per pass).
- **Message:** the harness's send-to-agent operation while the agent is live; otherwise
  a fresh agent whose brief points at the earlier report.
- **Wait:** end your turn. The harness notifies you when a background agent finishes,
  with its final reply, the report path; read the report then.
- **Watch:** the same notification arrives for every background agent you started, so
  there is nothing to arm for one no wait is on.
- **List:** the harness's list of running agents and background tasks.
- **Close:** stop the agent once its final reply has arrived.

## A child of another model family

This backend starts only native subagents of your own harness. A child of another model
family (which role does is the caller's policy: under the engineering loop, its
SKILL.md, Independent verification) is the Omnigent backend's
(the `omnigent-agents` skill); never start it with a bare CLI (`claude -p`, `codex exec`,
`omp`, `gemini -p`, `agy -p`) from a tool call, since nothing then lists, watches or
closes it. Without Omnigent, a fresh native subagent of your own harness is the only
child to start.
